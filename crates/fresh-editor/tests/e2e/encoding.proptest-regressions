# Seeds for failure cases proptest has generated in the past. It is
# automatically read and these particular cases re-run before any
# novel cases are generated.
#
# It is recommended to check this file in to source control so that
# everyone who runs the test benefits from these saved cases.
#
# Note: Old regression cases removed after updating latin1_text_strategy
# to exclude 0x80-0xBF range characters (valid UTF-8 continuation bytes)
# which caused ambiguous sequences like "é££" to be detected as UTF-8.
