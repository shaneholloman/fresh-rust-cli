# File Explorer

Fresh includes a built-in file explorer.

*   **Toggle Sidebar:** Use `Ctrl+B` to show/hide the file explorer sidebar. When a nested file is active, toggling on expands the tree and reveals the file.
*   **Focus:** Use `Ctrl+E` to switch focus between the file explorer and editor.
*   **Navigation:** Use the arrow keys to move up and down the file tree.

## Opening Files

- **Enter** opens the selected file and focuses the editor.
- **Single-click** opens a file in an ephemeral *preview* tab — the next single-click on another file replaces it instead of piling up tabs. Any real commitment — editing the file, pressing Enter, double-clicking, clicking the tab itself, or a layout action like splitting — promotes the preview to a permanent tab.
- **Double-click** opens the file in a permanent tab and focuses the editor.

Preview tabs are enabled by default. Turn them off in the Settings UI if you prefer every click to open a permanent tab.

## Width

The sidebar's width is configurable via `file_explorer.width` in settings. It accepts either form:

- A **percent** of the terminal width, e.g. `"30%"`.
- An **absolute** number of columns, e.g. `"24"`.

Dragging the divider preserves whichever form you configured — a sidebar set up as a percent stays a percent after you drag it.

## Visibility and .gitignore

- The file explorer respects your `.gitignore` by default, and auto-reloads when `.gitignore` changes on disk.
- A file is shown only if it isn't hidden by **any** active filter — so if a file is both a dotfile and gitignored, it takes enabling both toggles to see it.
- Use **Toggle Hidden Files** and **Toggle Gitignored Files** from the command palette to flip either filter. Both settings persist to config across sessions.
